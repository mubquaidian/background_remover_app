Background Remover App
It is very basic app to remove background of photos. This app is developed using Python and its libraries pillow and rembg.

The rembg library is based on a machine learning model called U-2-Net, which is a deep neural network designed for image segmentation tasks. U-2-Net is trained on a large dataset of images with foreground and background masks to learn the task of segmenting objects from their backgrounds.

The U-2-Net model used in rembg is based on the research paper titled "U^2-Net: Going Deeper with Nested U-Structure for Salient Object Detection" by Q. Q. Zhou, et al. The model architecture consists of a nested U-shaped network that leverages both low-level and high-level features to perform accurate and detailed object segmentation.

The rembg library utilizes this U-2-Net model to remove the background from an input image, providing a transparent foreground image as the output.

This app could be more refined to use as a single tool app or a component of large scale web app with other components.
